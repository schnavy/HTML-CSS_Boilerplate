This is a HTML Boilerplate Structure, provided for the course "Is it a room in a screen or a screen in a room?" at Burg Giebichtenstein Halle, by David Wahrenburg

In the following you will find an expanding Cheatsheet for the HTML and CSS Basics, covered in this course.

## HTML / CSS Cheatsheet

### 1. HTML Elements

The `<html>` Elements contains two main sections:
Inside the `<header>` you define metadata (`<meta>`), page title (`<title>`), links to stylesheets or favicons (`<link>`) . The Content of the `<header>` is not visible in the actual browser window.
Inside the `<body>` you will define all elements visible to the client inside the browser window.

The most important Elements to know:

`<div></div>` General Purpose Container – by far most used one

`<p>...</p>` paragraph for text

`<h1>...</h1> → <h5>…</h5>` Headings

`<a href="">...</a>` Links to subpages or external URLS

`<img src="" />` Images

Tables
```
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>...</td>
		<td>...</td>
	</tr>
</table>
```
Forms:
```
<form>
	<imput type="" />
	<label>...</label>
</form>
